This week's assignment was to better understand RAM through bit maniulation, and looping through memory registers. Students were expected to: 1) Manipulate the screen registers by spelling out the course code, 2) Perform division by using loops to continuously subtract, and 3) Combine loops/screen register manipulation to render the screen black.
