# CS220
Homework assignments I completed in MiraCosta's CS-220 (Computer Architecture and Assembly Language). This course focuses on topics like assembly language, memory addressing, general purpose input/output (GPIO), linking/compiling, interrupts, control structures, micro-controllers, and embedded systems.
