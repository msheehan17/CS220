<h1><b>CS-220</b>:Computer Architecture and Assembly Language</h1>

<hr>

<p>This course focuses on topics like assembly language, memory addressing, general purpose input/output (GPIO), linking/compiling, interrupts, control structures, micro-controllers, and embedded systems.</p>

<h3><b>Homework Assignments:</b></h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Basic Logic Gates:</b> Simple gates built from a Nand chip (i.e. Add, Or, and Not).</li>
  <li><b>Intermediate Logic Gates:</b> A collection of muliplexor gates, de-multiplexors, as well as 16-bit versions of the basic logic gates.
  <li><b>Combinational Logic and the ALU:</b> Gates that perform binary addition, as well as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), an integral part of the central processing unit (CPU). The ALU can perform 18 different operations on two 16-bit inputs.</li>   <li><b>Sequential Chips:</b> The basic blocks of building memory, such as a bit which can hold a state through delays.</li>
  <li><b>Machine Language:</b> Manipulating registers in memory responsible for display in order to create graphics.</li>
  <li><b>Computer Architecture:</b> Building the CPU, memory, and basic computer.</li>
  <li><b>Assembler:</b> The assembler, responsible for translating Hack assembly code into machine language for the CPU.</li>
  <li><b>VM Translator:</b> Translates VM code into Hack assembly.</li>
  <li><b>Jack Square Dance:</b> A simple Jack program that allows the user to more a square along the screen.</li>
  <li><b>Jack Tokenizer:</b> Breaks down various portions of Jack code (keywords, identifiers, strings, etc) into "tokens" in the form of a XML tree, so that the token file can be used for easier compiler translation.</li>
