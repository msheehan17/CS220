<h1><b>CS-220</b>:Computer Architecture and Assembly Language</h1>

<hr>

<p>This course focuses on topics like assembly language, memory addressing, general purpose input/output (GPIO), linking/compiling, interrupts, control structures, micro-controllers, and embedded systems. The course follows the nandtotetris software suite, which aims to "build a computer from the ground up".</p>

<h3><b>Homework Assignments:</b></h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Basic Logic Gates:</b> Built basic logic gates (and, or, not) which will be foundational guiding the logic in further gates.</li>
  <li><b>Intermediate Logic Gates:</b> Multiplexor and de-multiplexor gates, which can control the flow of logic based on a selector value. Additionally constructed 16-bit versions of the basic logic gates.
  <li><b>Combinational Logic and the ALU:</b> Developed gates that perform binary addition, as well as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), an integral part of the central processing unit (CPU). The ALU can perform 18 different operations on two 16-bit inputs.</li>   
  <li><b>Sequential Chips:</b> Building blocks of memory (bits), capable of maintaing state.</li>
  <li><b>Machine Language:</b> Manipulated registers in memory responsible for display in order to create graphics.</li>
  <li><b>Computer Architecture:</b> Created a CPU, memory, and a "basic computer".</li>
  <li><b>Assembler:</b> Assembled the assembler, which is responsible for translating Hack assembly code into machine language for the CPU.</li>
  <li><b>VM Translator:</b> Put together a VM translator, which translates VM code into Hack assembly.</li>
  <li><b>Jack Square Dance:</b> Implemented a simple Jack program that allows the user to more a square along the screen.</li>
  <li><b>Jack Tokenizer:</b> Designed a Jack Tokenizer, which breaks down various portions of Jack code (keywords, identifiers, strings, etc) into "tokens" in the form of a XML tree, so that the token file can be used for easier compiler translation.</li>
